# Basics of AI
This github is for intro of AIs and records of my learning. There might be problems inside my descriptions and codes. I'll try to summarize the basic models of AI/ML. It's glad to have suggestions from you.

The House Price Kaggle is a basic use of Machine Learning(ML). It is done by requirement of Lab2 by SC5002 in Nanyang Technological University. I'm the person whom done the code in the group work, so I upload it onto github. It may help you to better know how to use the Linear Regression. By the way, the limits of the Linear/Ridge Regression is that we assume dependent varaibles are directly proportional to the independent variables. 

The Clustering is based on Lab3 requirement by SC5002. It is individual work for a simple clustering. The limit of clustering is you don't actually know what is cluster meaning. unless the cluster itself is meaningful.(e.g. new stars/planets, using clustering to define them as a galaxy)

The Digit Recognization, as task of Lab4 of SC5002, is one of beginning tasks of Computer Vision(CV). Nowadays, we have Neural Networks and its relatives(CNN, RNN), and we have even more advanced model like Transformer. The models can be used to decompose image and find the relationships between lines, dots, colors and so on. The digit recognization can predict the handwriting words into its words in computer(Handwrite 1 -> Computer recognized it as "1"). However, due to different format of 1, it always have inaccurate prediction.
